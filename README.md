SWE-agent lets your language model of choice (e.g. GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet 3.7) autonomously use tools to:

* [fix issues in real GitHub repositories](https://swe-agent.com/latest/usage/hello_world),
* perform tasks on the web,
* [find cybersecurity vulnerabilities](https://enigma-agent.com/) (by solving Capture The Flag challenges), or
* [any custom task](https://swe-agent.com/latest/usage/coding_challenges).

It does so by using configurable [agent-computer interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15793) (ACIs) to interact with isolated computer environments.

SWE-agent is built and maintained by researchers from Princeton University and Stanford University.

## üí™ Key Capabilities

SWE-agent provides several powerful capabilities:

- **Isolated Environments**: Run agents in Docker containers to ensure safety and reproducibility
- **Multiple Model Support**: Use GPT-4, Claude, or any LiteLLM-supported model
- **Tool Use**: Provide agents with a configurable set of tools to interact with the environment
- **Function Calling**: Structured tool use with modern LLMs that support function calling
- **Cost Control**: Set limits on API costs to prevent unexpected expenses
- **Benchmarking**: Run agents on multiple tasks and evaluate their performance
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Interact with the agent during execution for debugging or assistance
- **Extensibility**: Add custom models, tools, environments, and hooks

## üèóÔ∏è Codebase Structure

SWE-agent is organized into several key modules:

### Core Components

- **Agent Module** (`sweagent/agent/`): Implements the agent logic and interaction with language models
  - `agents.py`: Contains the `DefaultAgent` class that manages the agent's execution flow
  - `models.py`: Handles different model backends (GPT, Claude, human-in-the-loop, etc.)
  - `problem_statement.py`: Manages the problem descriptions that the agent works on

- **Environment Module** (`sweagent/environment/`): Manages the execution environment
  - `swe_env.py`: Contains the `SWEEnv` class that provides an isolated environment (typically Docker containers)
  - Handles file system operations, command execution, and environment setup

- **Tools Module** (`sweagent/tools/`): Implements the tools available to the agent
  - `tools.py`: Contains the `ToolHandler` class that manages available commands
  - Handles command parsing, execution, and filtering

- **Run Module** (`sweagent/run/`): Contains the CLI interface and execution logic
  - `run_single.py`: Handles running a single agent instance
  - `run_batch.py`: Manages batch execution for benchmarking

### Execution Flow

1. The user provides a problem statement (GitHub issue, local file, etc.)
2. SWE-agent sets up an isolated environment (Docker container)
3. The agent iteratively:
   - Analyzes the problem and context
   - Decides on actions to take
   - Executes commands through the environment
   - Observes results and updates its understanding
4. The agent continues until it solves the problem or reaches a stopping condition

### Configuration

SWE-agent is highly configurable through YAML files and command-line arguments:
- Model selection and parameters
- Environment settings
- Tool availability and permissions
- Execution hooks for custom behaviors

### Extending SWE-agent

SWE-agent is designed to be extensible in several ways:

1. **Custom Models**: Add support for new language models by extending the `AbstractModel` class
   - Implement the `query` method to interact with your model
   - Register your model in the `get_model` factory function

2. **Custom Tools**: Add new tools by defining them in your configuration
   - Tools are defined as commands with optional parameters
   - Function calling is supported for structured tool use

3. **Custom Environments**: Create specialized environments by extending the `SWEEnv` class
   - Implement custom deployment types beyond Docker
   - Add specialized file system or network capabilities

4. **Custom Hooks**: Add hooks to modify agent behavior at different stages
   - Implement the `RunHook` interface to add custom behaviors
   - Hooks can be triggered at initialization, start, completion, etc.

## üîß Advanced Usage Examples

[SWE-agent: EnIGMA][enigma] is a mode for solving offensive cybersecurity (capture the flag) challenges.
EnIGMA achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple cybersecurity benchmarks (see [leaderboard](https://enigma-agent.com/#results)).
Please use [SWE-agent 0.7](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent/tree/v0.7) while we update EnIGMA for 1.0.

If you'd like to contribute to the codebase, we welcome [issues](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent/pulls)! For larger code changes, we always encourage discussion in issues first.

### Development Setup

#### Automated Installation (Recommended)

We provide two installation scripts for easy setup:

1. Basic installation:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```
   This script automatically creates a virtual environment using uv or conda (whichever is available) and installs all required dependencies.

2. Advanced installation with more options:
   ```bash
   ./install_advanced.sh
   ```
   This script provides additional options like Python version selection, system dependency checks, and more.

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed installation instructions.

#### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent.git
   cd SWE-agent
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
